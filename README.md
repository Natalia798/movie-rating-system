# Movie Rating System

## Overview

This project is a **Movie Rating System** that allows users to browse movies and TV shows, add favorites, rate content, and leave reviews. The project retrieves data from an external API (**TMDB**) and provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history.

The system is built using **React.js**, styled with **CSS**, and manages user interactions through **localStorage** for authentication, favorites, watchlist, and reviews.

## Features Implemented

âœ… Responsive design for both **mobile** and **desktop**
âœ… **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
âœ… **Movie and TV show grid** populated with data from **TMDB API**
âœ… **Pagination** for movies list
âœ… **Genre filtering**
âœ… **Search functionality**
âœ… **Sort functionality**
âœ… **Favorite movies/TV shows** feature
âœ… **Watchlist** feature for planned movies/TV shows
âœ… **Star rating system** to rate each movie/TV show
âœ… **User reviews** (comments for movies/TV shows)
âœ… **Trending now** section
âœ… **Top rated** section
âœ… **Recommended for You** section based on user's preferencies
âœ… **Recently Viewed** section based on viewing history
âœ… **Social media sharing** (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp)
âœ… **Basic authentication** (username & password stored in localStorage)

## Future Improvements
