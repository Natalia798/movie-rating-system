# Movie Rating System

## Overview

This project is a **Movie Rating System** that allows users to browse movies and TV shows, add favorites, rate content, and leave reviews. The project retrieves data from an external API (**TMDB**) and provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history.

The system is built using **React.js**, styled with **CSS**, and manages user interactions through **localStorage** for authentication, favorites, watchlist, and reviews.

## Features Implemented

- ✅ **Responsive design** for both **mobile** and **desktop**
- ✅ **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ **Movie and TV show grid** populated with data from **TMDB API**
- ✅ **Pagination** for movies list
- ✅ **Genre filtering**
- ✅ **Search functionality**
- ✅ **Sort functionality**
- ✅ **Favorite movies/TV shows** feature
- ✅ **Watchlist** feature for planned movies/TV shows
- ✅ **Star rating system** to rate each movie/TV show
- ✅ **User reviews** (comments for movies/TV shows)
- ✅ **Trending now** section
- ✅ **Top rated** section
- ✅ **Recommended for You** section based on user's preferences
- ✅ **Recently Viewed** section based on viewing history
- ✅ **Social media sharing** (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp)
- ✅ **Basic authentication** (username & password stored in localStorage)

## API Key Configuration

This project uses the **TMDB API** to fetch movie and TV show data.  
To run the project, you need to configure your **API key**:

1. Sign up at [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and get your API key.
2. Create a **`.env`** file in the root directory of the project.
3. Add the following line to your `.env` file:

   ```sh
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Restart the development server to apply the changes:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Future Improvements

- 🔹 Implement **email-based authentication** with validation and secure password storage (instead of localStorage)
- 🔹 Use **a real database** instead of localStorage for user data
- 🔹 Improve mobile responsive design for a better user experience

## Tech Stack

- **React.js** (Frontend framework)
- **CSS** (for styling)
- **TMDB API** (for movie and TV show data)
- **React Hooks** (for state management)
- **localStorage** (for authentication, user data, favorites, reviews, etc.)
- **Netlify** (for deployment)
